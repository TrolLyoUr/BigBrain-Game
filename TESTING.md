# Introduction
Testing is an essential part of software development to ensure the code is working as expected and to catch any potential bugs or issues early in the development process. In this project, we use a combination of unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests to verify the functionality and reliability of the application.

# Testing Tools
The main testing tools and libraries used in this project are:

1. Jest: A popular JavaScript testing framework that provides a flexible and powerful platform for running and organizing tests.
2. React Testing Library: A library built on top of Jest, which simplifies testing React components by promoting best practices and focusing on the user's perspective.
3. @testing-library/user-event: A library that simulates user interactions with the application, such as clicking buttons or typing text, making it easier to test user flows in the application.

# Testing Strategy
Our testing strategy is based on the following principles:

1. Unit Testing: Testing individual components or functions in isolation, focusing on their internal logic and behavior. This helps to ensure that each part of the application works correctly on its own.
2. Integration Testing: Testing the interactions between different components or functions, verifying that they work together correctly. This helps to ensure that the application's different parts work together as expected.
3. End-to-End Testing: Testing the entire application from the user's perspective, simulating real user interactions and flows. This helps to ensure that the application works as a whole and meets the user's needs.
